                            <p>   Hi, my name is Danny Jung. I am currently a junior at Dublin High School. As a kid, I was always fascinated by the idea of the internet revolutionizing the world. From that point on, a career that I aspired to become is a web developer/designer. In order to achieve such goals, it requires me to have an associateâ€™s degree in a 4 year college. The major that I require for my desired career is computer science, which is accredited by the ABET (Accreditation Board of Engineering Technology). Currently, I have taken classes that are related to the engineering field, which includes programming languages like HTML, CSS,and Python. The reason why I chose this career path is because I am always intrigued on how websites are created and I wanted to create content from my ability.  
                             <br>
                             <br>
                              Becoming an engineer was my goal because my dad was a software developer and it goes without saying that he has an important role in my choice. Specifically choosing to becoming a web developer came to me because I always wanted to try creating a program/website that can help change the world. Having that premise in mind made me want to pursue that specific career. As I took my Principles of Engineering class, I realized that there will be challenges that I have to face in this field. During the times I failed, I was able to acquire the skills to adapt to any situation and work diligently.

                             <br>
                             <br>
                             One of the strengths that I have is that I am able to multi-task. An example of me displaying my strengths is when I was doing a project in Principles of Engineering. One day my partner was absent and I had to work by myself. As I was continuing the project, I was working on both of our parts for the project that day. Being able to work by multitasking allowed me to get certain assignments done in a proficient amount of time. By the time my partner came back the next day, we were able to transition into the next steps of the project. I was able to quickly adapt to the situation and work proficiently at the same time.
